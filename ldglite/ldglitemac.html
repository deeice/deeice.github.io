Notes about <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>)</h1></center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) is an LDRAW viewer and editor for Macintosh users with MacOS
8.6 &shy;9.2. To run <B>LdGLite</B> you will also need to LDRAW files from <a href="http://www.ldraw.org/">www.ldraw.org</a>,
listed for the <B>Mac</B>, so get these if you haven’t yet got them.
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
First create your LDRAW directory containing the MODELS, PARTS and P sub-directories.
(Personally I placed my copy of the LDRAW directory in the same place as
the <B>LdGLite</B> program)
<p>Start <B>LdGLite</B> by double clicking on it. The first time you run <B>LdGLite</B>
you will be asked to identify the LDRAW subdirectory, when you have highlighted
the directory, press the select button on the “Open dialog box” (see below).
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="select.gif" ALT="Select LDRAW folder" BORDER=0 height=208 width=357></center>
<p>Once the LDRAW subdirectory has been identified, then the program will
prompt you to select and LDRAW file (normally ends with .dat). Select the
LDRAW data file and the screen will then display the model you have selected.</p>
<h2>Basic Controls</h2>
<center><p><img SRC="screen.gif" ALT="Example of a LdGLite (Mac) screen" BORDER=0 height=480 width=640>
<br><u><B>Mac</B> Screen in edit mode of an LDRAW model</u></center>
<p>(Note the program is in MacGLUT, which supplied the layout &shy; and
it is very un-<B>Mac</B> like)</p>
<p>There are only 3 menus ‘Apple’, File and RightButton (see above), ‘Help’
is a standard button and not implemented</p>
<p>The about in ‘<b>Apple</b>’ will tell you about the GLUT implementation
<br>The <b>File</b> Menu is restricted to Quit
<br>The <b>RightButton</b> menu (also accessible as a contextual menu ‘Cntrl
+ click’) has all of the controls. The main menu consists of: File, View,
Options, Background Colour, Bitmap, Help and Quit.</p>
<p>File:
<blockquote>Open &shy; Displays <B>Mac</B> “Open File” dialog box
<br>Save As &shy; Displays <B>Mac</B> “Save as” dialog box
<br>Editor &shy; Enter or leave Edit Mode for the Program</blockquote>
View:
<blockquote>Lists a variety of view options for the Lego model</blockquote>
Options:
<blockquote>Orthographic &shy; Displays the model without perspective distortion
<br>Perspective &shy; Displays perspective in the model, only works in
wireframe mode
<br>Shading &shy; Adds shadow effects to the model
<br>Line Mode &shy; Toggles between a wireframe model and a solid view
<br>Normal &shy; Reverts the display to solid view
<br>Studs &shy; Draws the model without connection studs (faster rendering)
<br>Visible Spin &shy; Should rotate the model &shy; Doesn’t work yet
<br>Step-Continuos &shy; Rendering of the model doesn’t wait for user input
<br>Parser &shy; Toggles between the L3parser and the LDLite parser
<br>Zoom In &shy; Get closer to the model
<br>Zoom Out &shy; Go away from the model
<br>Scale up &shy; Make the model bigger
<br>Scale down &shy; Make the model smaller</blockquote>
Background Colour:
<blockquote>Change the background colour</blockquote>
Bitmap:
<blockquote>Saves the current model as a Bitmap Image</blockquote>
Help:
<blockquote>Tells current version number</blockquote>
Quit:
<blockquote>Quit</blockquote>
<p>Most of the controls have key equivalents.
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This program is a Lego Cad program for the Macintosh. It is derived
from <B>LdGLite</B>, which is in turn a platform independent version of LdLite
(yes that was a tongue twister &shy; but it gets easier). <B>LdGLite</B> achieves
platform independency by using the OpenGL graphics interface and the GLUT
toolkit (techo stuff).
<p>LdLite is an LDRAW file viewer for Windows. You can use it to view DAT
and MPD files containing models made with everyone's favourite construction
bricks.
<p>LDRAW is a text only CAD program for DOS operation under Windows (now
all of the history has been revealed).
<p><B>LdGLite</B> currently runs in Windows, Linux, and MacOS. <B>LdGLite</B> does not
yet provide all of the functionality of LdLite. However it does have a
few small goodies not yet available in LdLite.
<p>Unfortunately <B>LdGLite</B> doesn’t compile easily for the MacOS and the resulting
program is very un-<B>Mac</B> like in its operation (but it does work). Therefore
<B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) is an attempt to create a user-friendlier version of <B>LdGLite</B>
that will run under MacOS 8.6 &shy; 9.2 (So far I have had very little
success with the user friendly part).
<p>For MacOS X users there is a compiled version of <B>LdGLite</B> on the <B>LdGLite</B>
website. However, as yet I haven’t attempted to “carbonise” this source
to make this program MacOS X compatible &shy; I firstly need to update
the (Open / Close dialog boxes as a minimum).
<p>To get from <B>LdGLite</B> to <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>), I have utilised <B>LdGLite</B> source
code where necessary and it remains about 90% original. I have then supplied
routines to interface more cleanly with the MacOS. So things such as the
<B>Mac</B> dialog boxes for opening and saving files work, an ability to access
the editor is available, Apple events are intercepted and actioned etc.
<p>In conclusion, I must acknowledge (he / she doesn’t supply a name) for
writing <B>LdGLite</B> (found at <a href="http://ldglite.sourceforge.net">http://<B>ldglite</B>.sourceforge.net</a>)
without whom there would be no program at all. Secondly I’m also indebted
to Erik Olson who converted <B>LdGLite</B> 0.5 to the original macLDG program.
Without Eric I wouldn’t have attempted converting this version of <B>LdGLite</B>.
<h2>
System Requirements</h2>
<B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) should run on any Macintosh with OpenGL installed and an
ATI graphics system. All iMacs, G3 towers, iBooks, G3 Powerbooks and G4’s
are fitted with ATI graphics systems. Additionally, most <B>Mac</B>’s produced
since about 1998 feature ATI graphics. Run the “System Profiler” under
the “Apple” menu. Select devices and volumes and look at the graphics system
to see if you have an ATI graphics system.
<p>ATI graphics are necessary as the GLUT toolbox is not compatible with
other graphics systems. Secondly MacOS 8.6 or higher is needed to run GLUT.
<p>Additionally to run <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) you will need LDRAW installed in a
folder on your hard disk. LDRAW is available from www.ldraw.org along with
installation instructions.
<p><b>Setting up your System to run <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>)</b>
<p>Before running <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) you will require that the LDRAW subdirectory
is present on your hard-disk and complete with the following:
<p>Subdirectory &shy; LDRAW
<p>Within LDRAW there must be these 3 Subdirectories; PARTS, MODELS and
P. (these directories contain the Lego parts database and primitives for
drawing them).
<p>Note it is vital that the spelling and capitalisation for the sub directories
are exactly as above, as Parts is not equal to PARTS.
<p>When you run <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) for the first time, you will be asked to
find the LDRAW subdirectory. Highlight your LDRAW subdirectory and press
the button marked “Select LRDAW”.
<p>This step will then allow <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) to remember where the subdirectory
is. (if you get this wrong, go to the preferences folder in the System
folder, find the file called “<B>LdGLite</B> Prefs” and drag this file into the
trash (ie delete it). Then next time you run <B>LdGLite</B> (<B>Mac</B>) it will re-ask
you to identify the LDRAW sub directory.

<h2>
Edit Mode</h2>
To enter the edit mode, either select it from the Menu or press the “Insert”
key. (Most Macs don’t have an Insert Key). Once the insert key has been
pressed, the screen will change to reveal 4 lines of text at the top.
<p>At this point a complete LEdit simulator will be operating. (LEdit is
a component of LDRAW). See the instructions for LEdit for a more complete
guide to LEdit. As with LEdit, there is no mouse support available for
manipulating the pieces at this stage. Additionally the shortcuts referred
to in LEdit (eg /V to alter the view mode) don’t function as they refer
to “Command line info operations” which is an ancient MS Dos feature not
available with the <B>Mac</B>.
<p>A summary of the commands for LEdit are;
<p>+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Increase magnification or zoom
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Decrease magnification or zoom
<p>PgUp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increment to the previous piece
<p>PgDn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decrement to the next piece
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rotate
current piece 90 degrees clockwise (as seen above)
<p>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prompt
to change colour then enter a colour number
<blockquote>0 = Black
<br>1 = Blue
<br>2 = Green
<br>3 = Dark Cyan
<br>4 = Red
<br>5 = Magenta
<br>6 = Brown
<br>7 = Grey
<br>8 = Dark Grey
<br>9 = Light Blue
<br>10 = Light Green
<br>11 = Cyan
<br>12 = Light Red
<br>13 = Pink
<br>14 = Yellow
<br>15 = White
<br>16 = Null &shy; Colour
<p>For transparent colours, add 32 to the above numbers (eg red = 32 +
4 = 36)
<p>NB Once a colour is set all new pieces will be that colour until it
is changed</blockquote>
E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redraws
the screen
<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Inserts a New Piece directly after the current one

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Move setting adjustment (cycles through the setting) The current setting
is shown at the top of the screen
<blockquote>Fine = 1/20 of a stud sideways or 1/8 of a plate thickness
up
<br>Normal = 1/2 of a stud sideways or 1 plate thickness up
<br>Coarse = 5 studs sideways or 10 plate thicknesses up</blockquote>
P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prompt for Piece
Number. Changes the current piece to the one specified
<blockquote>Eg 3001 = 2x4 brick, 3002 = 2x3 brick, 3003=2x2 brick etc.
<br>Getting brick id’s is problematic at this stage.</blockquote>
W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swap the current and
next pieces (not working).
<p>X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gets prompt
to move the current piece in the X direction. Enter the number of LDRAW
units you wish to move the piece.
<p>Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gets prompt
to move the current piece in the Y direction. Enter the number of LDRAW
units you wish to move the piece.
<p>Z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gets prompt
to move the current piece in the Z direction. Enter the number of LDRAW
units you wish to move the piece.
<p>ESC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brings up the LEdit Menus.
<p><b>LEdit Menus</b>
<p>Pressing ESC reveals the LEdit menus, as follows;
<blockquote>File

Extra Stuff (Taken Directly from the <B>LdGLite</B> Readme file)</h2>
Command line options (see also the original ldlite docs for more):
<p>-fh turns on shading mode.
<br>-fs turns off stud drawing. (l3glite only)
<br>-fsl draws studs as lines. (l3glite only)
<br>-fe turns off edge lines
<br>-fr same as -fe (Render mode? Rough draft? I don't know what R stands
for.)
<br>-ffT,E,S,R,G,B turns on fogging
<br>T = fogging type (1 = linear, 2 = exp2, 3 = exp3)
<br>E,S = end/far, start/near fog clip planes in linear mode.
<br>E,S = fog density, S= ignored param in exp mode.
<br>R,G,B = fog color (default = fade to white, try 0,0,0 for night scene)
<br>All fog params except T are optional.
<br>Try these: -ff3,0.0004 -ff3,0.0003,0,0.8,0.8,1.0
<br>-v0 displays in a 320x200 window.
<br>-v-1 displays in fullscreen with no decorations.
<br>-v-2 displays in fullscreen gamemode (no menus in gamemode).
<br>-v7 displays in 1600x1024
<br>-v8 displays in 1600x1200
<br>-vX,Y displays in an X wide by Y high window.
<br>-x displays the x,y,z axis.
<br>-ms Saves an image for each STEP and quits.
<br>-mS Does the same, but without opening a window.
<br>-iN picks output image type. 1 = PNG, 2 = Transparent PNG, 3 = BMP8,
4 = BMP24
<br>5 = PPM. Use -N to turn off output image cropping.
<br>-eN.NN fixes polyline offset driver errors. Try -e0.95 if lines look
bad.
<br>-p turns on polling mode.
<br>-ld forces the program to use the ldlite parser.
<br>-l3 forces the program to use the l3 parser.
<br>-le starts the program in LEDIT emulation mode.
<br>-lE starts the program in LEDIT emulation mode with solid moving pieces.
<br>-ledit or -LEDIT do the same but with draw-to-current and stud-as-line
on.
<br>-wN sets linewidth to N.
<br>-q quality lines (antialiased)
<br>-J picks the perspective projection.
<br>-zN sets the near clipping plane. (default = 10. 100 if GL_DEPTH_BITS
&lt; 24)
<br>-ZN sets the far clipping plane. (default = 4000)
<br>-caN sets the camera FOV angle in degrees. (like l3p, except default
= 45)
<br>-ccX,Y,Z sets the camera location. (like l3p, except default = 0,0,1000)
<br>-coX,Y,Z sets the model origin for the camera to look at. (default
= 0,0,0)
<br>-cuX,Y,Z sets the camera up vector. (default = 0,0,1)
<br>-lcX,Y,Z sets the light location. (like l3p, except default = -1000,1000,1000)
<br>-lcX,Y,Z,R,G,B sets the light location and color.
<br>-lCR,G,B sets the ambient lighting color.
<br>-uX,Y saves a huge output image from window sized tiles. (see notes
below)
<br>-&amp; windows mode. Detach from the console window. Windows version
only.
<br>-- if no DAT filename is given on the command line <B>ldglite</B> will read
<p>from stdin. (l3glite does not do this) Try this:
<p>cat file.dat | <B>ldglite</B> -v3 -ms --
<p>Kinda neat, but I don't know if this is good for much. Perhaps if you
have an application that generates dat files you can pipe the output through
<B>ldglite</B> and produce an image file. For example ldrawmode for&nbsp; emacs
could possibly be extended to use this to send a dat file in the buffer
out to the printer. (especially if I add postscript output)
<p>F10 enters fullscreen gamemode. (May be faster on some video cards)
<br>F9 exits fullscreen gamemode.
<br>Right Mouse button displays the popup menu.
<br>Left Mouse Drag will rotate the model.
<br>Shift Mouse Drag rotates the model in solid bounding box mode.
<br>Ctrl Mouse Drag rotates the model in solid studless mode.
<br>Arrow keys turn the viewpoint camera 5 degrees left, right, up, down.
<br>Alt Arrow keys roll the camera left, right, up, down.
<br>Ctrl Arrow keys move the camera left, right, up, down.
<br>PGUP and PGDN move the camera in and out (only visible in perspective
mode)
<br>0-9 keys pick one of the preset viewpoints.
<br>+ scales the model up to double size. (ALT + zooms in 10%)
<br>- shrinks the model by half. (ALT - zooms out 10%)
<br>S attempts to scale the model to fit the window. Needs work though.
<br>s toggles step/continuous mode
<br>g toggles polling mode.
<br>j picks the orthographic projection.
<br>J picks the perspective projection.
<br>r toggles the parser (LdLite or L3)
<br>n turns on normal (no) shading.
<br>h turns on shading.
<br>l turns on line only wireframe mode.
<br>f toggles stud drawing.

<br>b prints a BMP file. (use CTRL-b for 24 bit BMP)
<br>B prints a PNG file. (use CTRL-B for Alpha transparency)
<br>q toggles line quality (antialiasing)
<br>Esc quits.
<p>INSERT key toggles LEDIT emulation mode.
<br>(use CTRL-INSERT if you want to render the moving part solid)
<p>An excellent description of the LEDIT Hot Keys can be found at:
<p><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/20551/keys.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/20551/keys.html</a>
<p>LEDIT extensions
<p>The LEDIT emulation currently contains an extension to the linetype
menu to allow adding primitive linetypes 2-5. The parser for this ignores
commas and parenthesis so you can enter the points for a type 2 line like
this if you wish:
<p>Enter Coords for Type 2 Primitive: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (10.0, 10.0, 10.0)
<p>The color defaults to 16 for filled primitives and 24 for line primitives.
<p>Also, in addition to the x, y, z keys to translate the piece along an
axis, you can now use the v key to translate by an (x, y, z) vector.
<p>The Piece menu now also contains:
<br>an (x, y, z) location option
<br>an (x, y, z) scale option (use negative numbers to mirror)
<br>a matrix replacement option.
<br>an part inliner option.
<p>The Turn menu now also contains:
<br>an (x, y, z) origin option to select an arbitrary turn center.
<br>an option to toggle display of the three axis through the turn center.
<br>a rotate option (uses the part origin instead of the turn center)
<p>A Rotate menu has been added: Like the rotate option on the Turn menu.
<h2>
LEDIT emulation quirks</h2>
Part lookup is not currently supported. Try the <a href="http://www.nightsolo.net/lego/index.html">
printable parts catalog</a>.
<p>Empty lines are discarded by the L3 parser. Use a blank comment instead.
<p>Notes
<p>Use -uX, Y on the command line to build and save an image larger than
the screen made out of several tiles, each the size of the <B>ldglite</B> window.
This can be used in combination with the -W option for wide lines and/or
the -Q switch for antialiased lines to generate high quality instructions.
Currently this dumps PPM files instead of BMP files. PNG works, but transparent
backgrounds and cropping are not supported in tiled mode. <B>Ldglite</B> automatically
exits after saving the images (much like the -MS mode). The following command
renders the model in double size and saves a 2000 by 2000 PNG file. It
uses the l3 parser so it only has to parse the mpd file once for the multiple
rendering passes required for the tiles.
<p><B>ldglite</B> -l3 -i2 -s2 -w2 -u2000,2000 model.mpd
