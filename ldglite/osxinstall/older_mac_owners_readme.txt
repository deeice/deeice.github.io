(This happens with some other programs too.)    Green where gray should be, and fuchsia where white should be.    Rotating model restores proper colors. D = Trail lines during RotationE = Window starts with gooble-dee-goo (mixture of terminal window and last     ldglite window). View changes don't work, moving window empties it.     After moving window, a redraw calls up the AppleGL driver.F = A bit difficult to see selection in views 1, 2, 3, and 7.     Selection cannot be seen in views 4 and 5.G = Window starts with gooble-dee-goo (mixture of terminal window and last     ldglite window). View changes don't work, moving window empties it and    calls up the AppleGL driver, but window remains empty. Rotate or change    view draws model. 

*-LE is an LEDIT mode where bricks retain there normal appearance when moved.
 -le is an LEDIT mode where bricks revert to outlines when moved. 
 -l3 is a viewing mode that uses the "l3" parser to draw the models.
 -ld is a viewing mode that uses the "ld" parser to draw the models.**ATiGL = GL version, Vendor ATi Technologies v 1.2.22,         Renderer = ATi Rage 128 Pro Open GL Engine***AppleGL = GL version 1.1, Vendor Apple v1.1, Renderer = Generic-v800,537 at 32bit colors is the largest window that works without problems in -le mode.
