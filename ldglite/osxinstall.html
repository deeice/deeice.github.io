Many others have added to James' early work byadding editors and viewers for a variety of computer operatingsystems. Additionally, the library of bricks that can be used tobuild models continues to grow.</P><P>Ldglite is a port of ldlite. Ldlite was written by Paul Gyugyi,and that code was used as a starting point to create a cross platformversion of the program using the OpenGL graphics library. Thus thename ldglite. The original port of ldglite to OS X was a command linedriven program which had to be launched from a terminal window.Recently ldglite was converted into a double clickable Mac OS Xapplication, some bugs caused by the video drivers on older Applesystems were fixed, and the set-ldrawdir.command script was createdby Tom Bozzo to simplify the installation. Before this the LDRAWDIRvariable used by ldglite had to be set by hand using a terminalwindow, and ldglite had to be launched from the command line.</P></BODY></HTML>
