<B>What is ldglite?</B> <BR><BR>Ldglite is a program that lets you
view and edit Lego brick models stored in <A
href="http://www.ldraw.org/">LDRAW</A> format.  It was created by
connecting the <A href="http://ldlite.sourceforge.net/">LDLite</A>
DAT file parser to an <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>
rendering engine, making it portable to other operating
systems.  Along the way the L3 parser from <A
href="http://www.hassings.dk/l3/l3p.html">L3P</A> and a few
nifty features from other DAT file viewers such as <A
href="http://www.hassings.dk/l3/l3lab.html">L3Lab</A> were
added or emulated.  Most recently, an <A
href="http://www.ldraw.org/static/tutorial/home.html#ledit">LEdit</A>
emulation mode was added.  This gives you the ability to create and
edit models in ldglite in addition to the viewing capabilities.  The 
LEdit mode has several extensions including a hose maker that can also
be used to <A href="chaintest.html">generate minifig chains</A>.
Another new feature is the ability to function as a <A
href="ldglitepov.html">cheesy scene modeler</A> for <a
href="http://www.hassings.dk/l3/l3p.html">l3p</a> and <a
href="http://www.povray.org/">POV</a>.  Several internet sites use
ldglite as a scripted offscreen renderer, generating many pictures
of ldraw parts for inventory lists and such.  Possibly the most important
feature of ldglite is that all of the source code is available.

<BR><BR><B>My disclaimer:</B>

<BR><BR>Because portability is the main focus of ldglite, most folks
will probably feel more comfortable with one of the platform specific
programs available from the
<A href="http://www.ldraw.org/download/start/"> getting started page</A>
at www.ldraw.org.

<BR><BR> Of course you'll need the LDRAW parts library for this to
work.  If you don't already have it, visit the
<A href="http://www.ldraw.org/download/start/"> getting started page</A>
at www.ldraw.org and install it according to the directions for
your operating system.

<BR><BR><B>Compile your own :</B>

<BR><BR> So far I've used the <A
href="http://www.mingw.org/">Mingw32</A>
version of the GNU compiler, or Visual C++ 6.0 to compile it for
Windows95. I used the Mingw32 version that links with CRTDLL.DLL
instead of MSVCRT.DLL. Apparently using the other DLL causes problems
compiling. I'll have to look into that someday.  I've also compiled it
with gcc and <B>Mesa</B> for <B>Linux</B>.

<BR><BR><B>Windows version:</B><BR><BR>
<IMG src="ryu.png" align="left" hspace="0"><br clear="all"> <BR>
For Mingw32 you also need the <A 
href="glut-3.7.3-dlls.zip">glut DLLS</A> and the 
<A href="glheaders.zip">gl header 
files</A>. I got these dlls from <A 
href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html">http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html</A> 
and I can't remember where I got the gl headers files. Perhaps here <A href="http://sites.netscape.net/zaqhaq/glut.htm">GLUT for Mingw32</A> or here <A href="http://www.pms.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/mitarbeiter/panne/cygwin/opengl_glut.html">OpenGL and GLUT for Cygwin</A>.

Oh yeah, the makefile stinks.  But I patched it up a bit in version 0.7.2.
Now you should be able to just type <B>make</B> in the ldglite directory
and it will make both ldglite and l3glite with png support.

<BR><BR>Just for the heck of it I tried to build it in Visual C++ 6.0
and it actually worked. So if the GNU compiler scares ya, you can
still try it out. I just followed these <A
href="http://aslan.wheatonma.edu/~nbuggia/coursework/graphics/openGL_vcpp.html">directions</A>
for making a GLUT project in Visual C++ and added the .c source files
from the mingw32 version above.  You can just use
the ldglite or l3glite project files already included in the zip file.  Just
follow the first part of the directions above to install the GLUT dlls
and include files where Visual C++ likes them, then skip the rest of 
the instructions that tell how to make the project files.  <B>Note:</B>  The
project files are currently out of date since I don't have access to 
Visual C++ right now.

<BR><BR>By default the windows versions look for the LDRAW dir at
c:\legos\ldraw. You can override this by setting the environment
variable LDRAWDIR.  Yeah, I know this is a step backwards for ldlite
users, but it's portable.  As of version 0.7.2 you can skip this 
in windows if you have the ldraw.ini file from some other LDRAW 
type program.

<BR><BR><B>Linux version:</B> <BR><BR>
<IMG src="snapshot01.gif"> <BR>
Check the <B><A href="https://github.com/deeice/ldglite/blob/master/readme.txt">readme.txt</A></B> in the
zip file for more information about building the Linux version.  You
should be able to build with just a <B>make -f makefile.linux</B> in
the ldglite directory.  As of version 0.7.2 l3glite is just a softlink
to ldglite.  If you have trouble with the png support try deleting
z*.h and png*.h from the ldglite directory.  If that doesn't work then
check the notes in makefile.linux to try a build without png support.
My copy of Mandrake 6.1 didn't seem to make all the soft links for the
Mesa GL libraries so I had to link them by hand.  See <B><A
href="https://github.com/deeice/ldglite/blob/master/readme.txt">readme.txt</A></B>.

<BR><BR> For linux I set all file operations to lowercase DAT
filenames.  When I unarjed the ldraw DAT file archives in linux they
came out in lowercase, so that's what I'm going with.  You can set the
environment variable LDRAWDIRCASE to UPPERCASE if for some reason
you prefer uppercase filenames.  I think they're more work.  The ldraw path
defaults to /usr/local/ldraw.  You can override this with the LDDRAWDIR 
environment variable.  Your ldraw path probably doesn't match if you only 
get a blank window.  Directions for automatically viewing DAT files from
lugnet with <B>Netscape Navigator</B> are also in the
<B><A href="https://github.com/deeice/ldglite/blob/master/readme.txt">readme.txt</A></B> file.

<BR><BR><B>Mac OS X version:</B> <BR><BR>
Since Mac OS X is BSD with a candy coating, the linux code worked fine
after a few small changes.  You should be able to build with just a
<B>make -f makefile.macx</B> in the ldglite directory. I had to remove
the png support for now until I get around to building libpng on OSX.
